# jupyter-navigation
With a little css magic and html you can add a sidebar menu to your jupyter work.

Here is the description
1. create a class that has a fixed postion with a set left and top location
2. Map out the location that you want to jump to and create a menu entry for those locations
3. Create a label in at the specified locations

Use the sample code to build your custom sidebar. Please email me with any enhancements, thoughts or places that this helped.

All the best and thanks.
