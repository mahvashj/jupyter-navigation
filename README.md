# jupyter-navigation
With a little css magic and html you can add a sidebar menu to your jupyter work.<br><br>

Here is the description<br>
1. create a class that has a fixed postion with a set left and top location<br>
2. Map out the location that you want to jump to and create a menu entry for those locations<br>
3. Create a label in at the specified locations<br><br>

Use the sample code to build your custom sidebar. Please email me with any enhancements, thoughts or places that this helped.<br><br>
